<h2><i>The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance (2019)</i></h2>
<br>
<p>If you were to witness Riggan’s entrance to the bar, it would be understandable to judge him as distasteful. You would be excused for doing so. He’s glowering behind his a-little-later-than-5’o-clock shadow, fidgeting like a junky, and wearing a tan overcoat suspiciously similar to one I once purchased from a Goodwill for $7.50. </p>
<br>
<p>“All of this is fine”, you say from your lounge seat in the bar corner; “Maybe he’s just world-weary”. He buys a drink from the bartender and stumbles towards a woman. Slumped into a black cardigan, and stabbing angrily at her notepad as if it wronged her, she grudgingly swivels her head when Thompson offers the drink. He starts a conversation. </p>
<br>
<p>“Oh good!”, you exclaim to no one in particular, “Maybe he’s a nice guy and he’s just nervous about putting himself out there!” You smile to yourself, your seemingly correct value judgement of a stranger emboldening you to ‘never judge a book by its cover’. Back at the bar, Riggan’s half-hearted glower has been upgraded to an impassioned scowl; he raises his voice. His hand waves a finger in her face and then searches for something to hurl. An innocent bystander- an empty glass left on the bar- is chosen. The sound of its shattering explodes through the room as you spit out your drink. His voice is loud enough now so that everyone can hear it. </p>
<br>
<p><i>“Labels, these are all just fucking labels!”.</i> Riggan, breathing raggedly like some sort of coked out apex predator, lays prose like carpet bombs on her, articulating his qualms with the raw passion of an anger management patient who’s just stepped on a Lego. </p>
<br>
<p><i>“…Nothin’ about intention, structure, just crappy opinions backed up by even crappier comparisons. You’re incapable of writing more than a couple of paragraphs… and you know what… none of this cost you fucking anything, you risk nothing, nothing, nothing for yourself… well I’m a fucking actor.”</i> He tears the first leaf of paper from her notepad, brandishing it inches from her nose. </p>
<br>
<p><i>“So you take this fucking, malicious, cowardly, shittily-written review, and you shove that right the fuck up your wrinkly, tight… “</i>. His words are lost as the pianist, paid to create an ambiance and having realized that Riggan’s outburst was handily dismantling it, struck up an invigorated tune. From your corner of the bar, the music was so that the conversations became distant and spiraled until no word was intelligible from the next.</p>
<br>
<p>To you, it may have appeared that Riggan was berating this elderly woman needlessly, but not to us. We, the audience, were privy to a few facts. Years ago, Riggan was an actor in Blockbuster superhero movies. Now, he’s writing and starring in a Broadway play that he hopes will force the art world to take him seriously. A seemingly straightforward task, but imagine if Adam Sandler tried to film a documentary on Syrian immigrants. His play will debut in days, but Riggan has doubts as to whether the production is ready. The old woman- the target of Riggan’s rage- was the esteemed Broadway critic, Tabitha Dickinson. She’s sworn to axe his play in the papers the night of its debut. </p>
<br>
<p>And now, we may all sit back, understand, and even appreciate the wellspring of Riggan’s mania. This play is his one shot at cementing his legacy as an artist instead of a hack. It’s the culmination of years of being underestimated and misjudged- his proudest accomplishment, his Sistine Chapel, and after it debuts, he’ll have to face the face the stage lights, prostrate himself before the audience and the critics, and hope for the best. Dickinson’s intention is to render all of his work for naught. </p>
<br>
<p>If I were to take sides for strictly moral reasons, I would gravitate towards Riggan. Tabitha’s a bit of a dick in this scene. Why kill a play that you haven’t even seen yet? I mean, come on. As far as jaded movie villains go, Tabitha is a bit over the top. I don’t fault her. She can’t help how her character was written, and I think that the negative stereotype applied to critics is a weary one. We have the conniving Tabitha Dickinson with the welcoming gaze of a spoiled melon, and may you recall the lanky, egg-like man who plays a food critic in the film “Ratatouille”? His name was literally “Anton Ego”. Even the word “critic” just sounds unpleasant- like “critter” or “parasitic”. But I think critics get a bad rep. I follow Jerry Saltz on Instagram and he doesn’t seem that cynical. In fact, where would we be without critics? If some eccentric in Italy decided to shit in a can and call it art, who would stop him? The fact that we live in a dystopia where critics not only allowed but <i>enabled </i>Piero Manzoni to have his poop displayed in the Tate Modern speaks to their open-mindedness. Speaking on Manzoni’s shit, art critic Stephen Bury said: “It is a joke, a parody of the art market, and a critique of consumerism and the waste it generates”. Doesn’t he sound like a cool dad – the type who might “vibe” with his son’s noise band? Damn critics! Point taken! </p>
<br>
<p>Let’s take a look at the scoreboard. Currently, it’s one to one: Riggan’s point because he is (technically) the victim here, and Tabitha’s because she’s an unwilling slave to the rigid, no-fun critic stereotype. And ultimately, though they’re locked in eternal conflict, I believe that Tabitha and Riggan have more in common than they realize. Critics and artists are like referees and soccer players- remove either group from the field and your soccer game becomes pandemonium. Riggan and Tabitha are like the head and tail of the snake that eats itself in that one Greek myth- neither could exist without the other. Every deeply-pretentious, ill-conceived Broadway play must answer to the critics. And every maligned, under-researched review will be viciously questioned by the artists. And thus, the wheel of human creativity lazily carries culture forward. Vibrant humanities students will graduate and become newer iterations of Riggan and Tabitha- cooperating, dissenting, collaborating, and screaming in each other’s faces. It brings a smile to my young, dumb face, to know that this is the way it’s always been, and this is probably the way it will always be. </p>
