        <h2>Racket Sort</h2>
            <p>I was a sophomore in winter break of 2017, I had been a computer science major for just shy of a year, but I was still hesitant about delving into the field fully. 
                This changed when I joined a book club among my coworkers where we read “The Little Schemer”. Scheme is a “dialect” of the Lisp programming language that was birthed 
                in the 1970’s. Not only was it was my first experience with a functional programming language, but I had never before used a language that negated any sort of looping mechanism. 
                As a third-semester CS student, I had finished an intro class on data structures. The importance of recursion had only just been impressed on me. It’s basically a horribly inefficient version of insertion sort.
