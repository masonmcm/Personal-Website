        <h2>Racket Sort</h2>
        <p>I was a sophomore during winter break of 2017, and I had been a computer science major for just shy of a year, but I was still hesitant about delving into the field fully. Before heading home for Christmas, I joined a bookclub where we finished “The Little Schemer” by Daniel P. Friedman and discussed each weeks readings in Slack. Scheme is a “dialect” of the Lisp programming language that was birthed in the 1970’s. Not only was it was my first experience with a functional programming language, but I had never before used a language that favored recursion over any sort of looping mechanism. I wrote code in Racket (a different language based on Scheme) as I read, and ended up trying to write my own sorting algorithm. The final product is somewhat similar to insertion sort.
